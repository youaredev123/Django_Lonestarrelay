			<h2>Below is a recap of award winners in 2011!</h2>
			<p>____________________________________________________________________________________<br /></p>
			<p>We suspected that the TIR course record was in jeopardy of going down&hellip; did it ever.&nbsp; The <strong>Fleet Feet 
			Terlingua</strong> (of Terlingua Track Club, and captained by <strong>Jose Lara</strong>) put on a distance running clinic, 
			clicking off 5:45miles all the way through, winning in 19:26:10.&nbsp;<br />

			style="border-width: 1pt; border-style: solid;" width="725"><br />
			No, this is not a typo, they bettered the previous course record by almost 2 hours.&nbsp; It was business-like the way in 
			which they hammered out impressive leg after impressive leg&hellip; lining them up, and knocking them out.&nbsp; Congrats to 
			The Fleet Feet Terlingua for a ridiculous relay win and nice re-write of the TIR course record!&nbsp; Of course, it was a 
			complete team victory, but if there was a runner of the event, it would be <strong>Sesar Figueroa</strong>.&nbsp; Sesar is 
			a 4 minute miler, and currently the top runner in Houston.&nbsp; He ran ~5:15s for over 18 miles at the 2011 TIR.<br />
			&nbsp;<br />
			Three other teams joined Fleet Feet Terlingua in finishing well below the old record.&nbsp; The mixed team from Dallas, 
			<strong>Dolls n Towel Boyz</strong> (led by <strong>Steve Henderson</strong>), took second overall, running just a smidge 
			over 6min/mile pace for the entire distance.&nbsp;<br />
			<img alt="" border="2" height="425" src="{% static '/images/Screen_shot_2011_03_11_at_1.11.46_PM.png' %}" 
			style="border-width: 1pt; border-style: solid;" width="725"></p>
			<p>For much of the race, they ran neck-and-neck with the returning champions, <strong>The Tornados</strong> (headed up by 
			<strong>Leno Rios</strong>), before putting a little more of a gap on the Tornados as they navigated through Houston.&nbsp; 
			These two teams have battled it out against each other for two years now, trading wins over the other, and BOTH had nothing but 
			praise to say about the other team!&nbsp; They even finished up the TIR&#39;s epilogue together.&nbsp;<br />
			<img alt="" border="2" height="425" src="{% static '/images/Screen_shot_2011_03_11_at_1.15.55_PM.png' %}" 
			style="border-width:1pt; border-style: solid;" width="725"></p>
			<p>The team, <strong>More Pain Please!!</strong> (with captain <strong>Jace Huering</strong>), also provided a remarkable 
			effort (20:55:56 / 6:11 pace) to finish under the previous course record.&nbsp; We observed all of these teams over the 
			first several legs of the race, and they were all awesome indeed!<br />
			<img alt="" border="2" height="425" src="{% static '/images/Screen_shot_2011_03_11_at_1.21.13_PM.png' %}" 
			style="border-width: 01pt; border-style: solid;" width="725"><br />
			&nbsp;<br />
			Speaking of rockin&rsquo; the course, the all women squad, <strong>Red Hot Chili Chicas</strong> (<strong>Kim McClintic</strong> 
			at the helm) were true to their name as they obliterated the 3-year women&rsquo;s team record.&nbsp; The Red Hot Chili Chicas 
			ran right at 7-flat pace (23:41:22), and they made it look super fun and easy every step of the way!<br />
			<img alt="" border="2" height="400" src="{% static '/images/Screen_shot_2011_03_11_at_1.23.23_PM.png' %}" 
			style="border-width: 1pt; border-style: solid;" width="725"><br />
			&nbsp;<br />
			Finally, we tip our hats to the Corporate Cannon winner (once again, in record breaking time!) to the corporate team, 
			<strong>Fire In The Belly, from Apache Corporation</strong> (captained by <strong>Jarrett Hubert</strong>)!&nbsp; Fire In The 
			Belly ran the excellent time of 24:40:56, putting in just over a full day&rsquo;s work, literally running &lsquo;round the clock 
			at a 7:18 clip.<br />
