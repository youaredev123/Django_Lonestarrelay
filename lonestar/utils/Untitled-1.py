		"<p>Relay legs?  36<br />People legs?  ~4,400</p>",
		"<p>Up to 12. If you plan to run with fewer than 8, please <strong><a href='mailto:jay@texasindependencerelay.com'>contact us</a></strong>.</p>",
		"<p>Every team is allowed up to 2 vehicles, and most teams choose to go with 2 vans. 			Many prefer large 12 or 15-passenger vans, but we have done relays using minivans, and they have worked just fine.  A team could go all in one large 15-passenger van, 			but this will result in the team having few opportunities to stray off the course as they will always need to get the next runner to the next exchange.  Having 			2 vans allows one van to cut away for awhile (this van is called the 'resting van') while the other van with the next several runners (this one is called the  'active' van) takes care of the relaying for awhile until they switch off. <br/><br/><br />			For example, a team of 12 could take both vans to almost all the exchanges, but then when it gets towards evening, one van could have the runners for legs 16-21, 			while the other van of 6 goes to Wallis to catch a few winks.  Then, shortly after the leg 21 runner begins their run to Wallis (Exchange 21), the current active 				van will call the resting van to let them know that the exchange in Wallis will be happening in about 30 minutes.  Then, the two vans will switch roles... the 			one that had been resting will soon become the Active van, handling legs 22-27, and the one that took care of legs 16-21 will have a few hours to rest before meeting 			back up with the team (most likely at Exchange 26 or 27).</p>",
		"<p>A `rotation` is the order or runners, or `line-up` that a team uses to run the TIR.  There 			are any number of rotations that could be used, but for this question we'll be providing 4 popular samples... These are named: 1) The Straight Rotation, 2) The 			Ability-Based Rotation, 3) The Meet-&-Greet Rotation, and 4) The Stinky Van Rotation.<br/><br/><br />			<strong>The Straight Rotation</strong> is simply where runners are numbered 1 - 12 (for a team of 12) and run in this order throughout.  The legs would be distributed 			as follows:<br />			Runner #1:  Legs 1, 13, 25, and 37<br />			Runner #2:  Legs 2, 14, 26, and 38<br />			Runner #3:  Legs 3, 15, 27, and 39<br />			Runner #4:  Legs 4, 16, 28, and 40<br />		Runner #5:  Legs 5, 17, and 29<br />			Runner #6:  Legs 6, 18, and 30<br />			Runner #7:  Legs 7, 19, and 31<br />			Runner #8:  Legs 8, 20, and 32<br />			Runner #9:  Legs 9, 21, and 33<br />			Runner #10: Legs 10, 22, and 34<br />			Runner #11:  Legs 11, 23, and 35<br />			Runner #12:  Legs 12, 24, and 36<br/><br/></p>			<p>Typically, teams running a straight rotation will keep runners #1-6 in one van (we'll call it Van A) and runners #7-12 in the other (Van B).  So, when the race 			begins and runner #1 is off on leg 1, Van A is the `Active` van and Van B is the `Resting` van.  For the first 5 exchanges Van A will ensure that the next runner 			gets to the exchange ready to go before the current runner finishes.  But after Exchange 5 (when runner #6 is on the course), Van A will be calling Van B to make sure 			that they will be at Exchange 6, with runner #7 ready to take the hand-off from Runner #6.  At Exchange 6, the two groups and vans are swapping roles with Van B 			becoming the `Active` van and Van A becoming the `Resting` van.  They will carry on in this fashion throughout.  Van A will be `Active` for Legs 1-6, 13-18, 			25-30, and 37-40, and resting for Legs 7-12, 19-24, and 31-36.  Van B, conversely, will be the Active van for Legs 7-12, 19-24, and 31-36, and resting for Legs 1-6, 			13-18, 25-30, and 37-40.  Both vans will need to be at Exchanges 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36. <br/><br/></p>			<p><strong><a href=`/files/TIR_Pace_Predictor_Van_Rotation_Straight.xls` onclick=`javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','download','/files/TIR_Pace_Predictor_Van_Rotation_Straight.xls']);`>Linked here is the predictor spreadsheet (with 			Van Rotation at the bottom). It shows the allocation of the legs and the total mileage for each runner for a straight rotation.</a></strong><br/><br/><br />			<strong><br />The Ability-Based Rotation</strong> is one in which the team allocates legs according to it's strengths.  In this example, Betty and Barney are both 			veteran runners who enjoy running longer, while Fred and Wilma are relatively newer to running and would prefer shorter legs.  So, the team will run close to straight 			rotation, but will just make a couple of tweaks to accommodate these team members.  There is a little bit of switching around in the vans, but it is not that difficult. 			Both Betty and Barny get over 24 miles each, and Fred and Wilma get 11 and 14 miles in total.<br/><br/></p>			<p><strong><a href=`/files/TIR_Pace_Predictor_Van_Rotation_Ability-Based.xls` 			onclick=`javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','download','/files/TIR_Pace_Predictor_Van_Rotation_Ability-Based.xls']);`>Linked here is the predictor spreadsheet (with 			Van Rotation at the bottom) using the Ability Based Rotation described above. It shows the allocation of the legs and the total mileage for each runner for this 			rotation.</a></strong><br/><br/><br/></p>			<p>Finally, <strong>the Meet-&-Greet Rotation</strong> is likely the easiest rotation, and it's the one we would likely use if we were running the relay!  The 			Meet-&-Greet is the most social, and for most of the relay it almost doesn't matter who is in which!  Since the TIR allows both vans at the exchanges, the Meet-&-Greet 			has both vans going so that the team stays together a lot more.  Also, `cross-pollination` between vans is easy, so spending time with all of your teammates is simple. 			From time to time, one vanload may want to break away to get something to eat.  Some of you may want to hang out in Shiner, Flatonia, Schulenburg, or Weimar for a little longer. 			Again, this can be done without any problems... just make sure the other van has the next few runners and they know that they are `on` as the Active van, and you're 			all set!  At Exchange 15 (the finish of Leg 15), separate your team into 2 groups... Leg 16 - 21 runners, and the rest of you.  The 15th leg runner will hand off to 			your Leg 16 runner, and the Leg 16-21 runners will commence taking care of the running for 3-5.5 hours.  (The distance between Exchange 15 and Exchange 21 is 32.29 			miles, so it will take 3 hours for a team running 5:34 pace and 5.5 hours for a team running 10:12 min/mile pace.)  The rest of your team will head to Wallis to flop 			down and maybe get a shower at their High School.  They do `suggest` a $5/person donation that they use as a fundraiser for their Spring Teacher Appreciation Banquet. 			Shortly after the Active van (Leg 16 - 21 runners) make the hand-off at the 20th exchange, the active van should call ahead to let the resting half know that the Leg 21 			runner will be arriving in Wallis soon!  The 22-27 Leg runners will then prepare to carry on the team's progress, and after the exchange at 21, the Leg 16 - 21 runners 			will have their chance to rest a little bit at the High School.  A good choice of where to meet up again would be at Exchange 26, the Luke's Locker in Cinco Ranch!  			This is 25.47 miles from Exchange 23 (and it takes about 35-40min to drive there), so the Leg 16-21 runners will not have as much time to stay at the high school. After 			bringing the team back together again, you will carry on with both vans as you were before.<br/><br/> </p>			<p><strong><a href=`/files/TIR_Pace_Predictor_Van_Rotation_Meet-n-Greet.xls` 			onclick=`javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','download','/files/TIR_Pace_Predictor_Van_Rotation_Meet-n-Greet.xls']);`>Linked here is the predictor spreadsheet (with 			Van Rotation at the bottom) using the Meet & Greet Rotation described above.</a></strong><br/><br/></p>			<p>Just for grins, <strong>The Stinky Van Rotation</strong>, is a variation of the Meet-&-Greet that some teams enjoy.  With the Stinky Van, the team immediately sends 			(or banishes?) every runner who finishes a leg to the stinky van.  This rotation ends up providing runners with a few hours of clean air in the clean van before they 			run, so that's a plus! <br/><br/> </p>			<p>Again, there are many more rotations you could use!  But no matter which scheme you go with, the most important rule to go by is to always... ALWAYS... make sure 			you get your next runner to the next exchange before the current runner gets there!  As long as you just do that, youll have done the relay successfully!</p>",
		"<p>Yeppers... for reals!</p>",
		"<p>Maybe.  </p>",
		"<p>Yes, there are rules designed with everyone's safety in mind, for teams to compete fairly, and to keep 			the race moving smoothly.  They are linked below, and upon registering, you are required to check the box to indicate that you are aware of the rules and agree with 			the release of liability.</p>			<p><strong><a href=`/files/TIR_Rules.pdf` onclick=`javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','download','/files/TIR_Rules.pdf']);`>The RULES! </a></strong></p>",
		"<p>NO! Although every other relay requires teams within 100 miles of the course to provide 2 volunteers, we 			are happy to save you from this significant hassle!!  That said, if you or someone you know would like to help, by all means, please let us know. </p>",
		"<p>Yes, teams smaller than 8 may participate, but please contact us if this is your plan.</p>",
		"<p>Teams need to be able to move along the course at about a 10:45-11:00 per mile 			pace or faster.  Keep in mind, though, that the 10:45 pace required does not mean that every runner has to be able to run that.  If a team has a runner that runs 			8:30 pace, then that offsets a 12:45 pace runner on the same team.  If you want to participate in the TIR, but do not think your team can run this pace, we do allow 			you to sign up as a `Untimed` team.  Untimed teams are allowed to periodically forego traditional hand-offs, starting some runners early, in order 			to move along the course at a faster rate.  For example, if you start your next runner 15minutes early on 4 different occasions (please remember to not leave your 			runner that's coming in!), your team will `save` an hour (which works out to 17 secs per mile).  Of course, these teams are separated out in the final results 			as we will not know their actual time.  In the 2011 TIR, a team with a few walkers were able to complete the relay in this fashion.<br/><br/><br />			The average pace for all the teams is 8:30min/mile, which results in an average finishing time of just under 29 hours.  In our experience, we know that teams almost 			always run faster than they think they will.... that's just how it is... we don't know why!</p>",
		"<p>We work with each team to establish a predicted pace. Almost every team sandbags, meaning they submit 			a time that is slower than what they will run, but we know that is not your team (smile)!<br/><br/><br />			These predicted times help us slot every team's start time.  The slowest teams - those looking to run between 10:00 and 11:00 min/mile - start earliest on Saturday 			morning.  The first team will start at 6:00AM. Then, the majority of teams will receive start times in the 7:00 to 11:00AM time frame.  Finally, the really speedy 			folks start in the afternoon, with the very fastest starting after 2PM.<br/><br/><br />			Those very fastest teams will reach the monument first... and actually quite a bit ahead of the pack.  Most teams reach the San Jacinto monument between 1 and 4PM 			on Sunday, but several teams continue to finish all the way until about 6:00PM.</p>"

		"<p>First, a little bit of prevention goes a long way towards keeping teammates committed.  Ensuring that 			your teammates have a little skin in the game simply 			works!  Some team captains collect all of the entry fees upfront, indicating that these are non-refundable.  Also, keep your team members engaged by reminding them of the 			TIR frequently.  Finally, explicitly communicate 			your expectation that your team members not flake out, but IF for some reason they think they may back out it is absolutely imperative that they let you know as soon as 			possible.  It is one thing to find a sub a few weeks 			out from the event - very doable.  It is a little more difficult to find a replacement runner a day or two from the race.</p>			<p>In advance, have a couple of potential substitute teammates lined up, just in case one of your teammates can not run.  Also, keep in mind, that you can run the TIR with 			fewer teammates.  If you have a team of 12 (so 4 			were running 4 legs and 8 were running 3 legs), but one bails, then your team of 11 could run it with 7 running 4 legs and 4 running 3).  For this reason, many teams go for 			having teams of 12 - so that if 1 or 2 can't run, they are still okay.</p>			<p>In the last couple of weeks, activity on the Texas Independence Relay facebook page will be increased (with teams looking for replacements).  If your team has already 			paid for a whole team's entry fee, or your team has 			paid individually, reaching 12 members, we do not charge any fee for this substitution.  However, all teammates must register in order to acknowledge the rules and 			liability release before running in the TIR.</p>",
		"<p>Unlike most overnight relays, the TIR allows flexibility in team size as well as for the allocation of the legs!  The largest 			determining factor in how much every one on the 			team is running is the team size.  Runners on teams of 8 will run about 25 miles each, while runners on teams of 12 will run ~17 miles on average over the course of the 			weekend.<br/><br/><br />			If you have a newer runner who doesn''t run much, you can give this runner 3 of the shorter legs so that they are only running about 12 miles in total with breaks in 			between!  Or, you can give your mileage junky the longer 			legs.  You can have runners do back-to-back legs, if that works best for your team.

(My husband, a retired Army officer, calls it an “operations order.”)  The schedule 			lists every exchange and includes who is in which 			van, who is running and in what order.  It’s idiot proof, or should I say, friendly to those who are sleep deprived and not hinking properly.  The schedule also tells 			approximately how much time each vanload can spend at the junior high gym in Wallis to allow for travel time.  It works very well!</p></blockquote>			<p><br/><br />			<strong>2) Craig Potts, A Multi-year participant and Team Captain, has informed us that:</strong></p>			<blockquote><p>It's a good idea to print out the leg directions, have them laminated, and then cut them up into the individual legs so that your teammates can carry them on 			their leg without them getting totally destroyed beyond recognition.</p></blockquote>"

		"<p>The TIR Prologue and Epilogue runs accentuate the team aspects of the TIR.  They are short celebratory runs that teams complete 			together.

However, from Flatonia to Columbus, the 			hills begin to flatten, and then from Columbus through Houston, the course is flat.  That's not to say that there are no hills... even the last leg has a nice incline to go 			over the 225 overpass!</p>",
		"<p>Usually.</p>",
		"<p>Consult the <strong><a href=`/map` >Interactive Course Map</a></strong> for all the course info you could 			want!  You can zoom in and out on the course map, review leg elevation profiles, and click on the legs to read more about them!</p>",
		"<p>Yes, the course is marked.  Primarily, you will be on the lookout for painted (temporary paint) arrows and orange cones 			where there are turns.  The TIR arrows consist of a red dot, a blue dot, and then a white arrow.  Also, the cones have an easy-to-see reflective arrow sticker on them, 			pointing you in the way you should go.  That said, it is imperative for every runner to know their legs so that they could run them with no markings!  Use the markings 			to confirm that you're on the route rather than completely relying upon on them.</p>",
		"<p>The course maps provided on the website as well as in your event booklets are detailed, and they have the precise 			coordinates of where each exchange is located.  When you are coming upon an exchange, you will find it easy to recognize.  There is a painted Texas flag on the pavement, 			a pop-up tent with a Come and Take It flag, and are large Texas swooper flag.  There will be people at the exchanges, and at night most of the exchanges have large 			construction lights. <br/><br/><br />			You won't need to worry  about noticing the exchanges, but you will want to make extra sure that you are going to the right one!  The first exchange is AFTER leg 1, 			Exchange 2 is at the end of leg 2, and so on!</p>",
		"<p>Yes, there are well over 100 officers that help out with the TIR (many assisting throughout Houston at traffic 			lights).  There is also EMS that moves along with the event throughout the duration of the TIR.  This year, we're excited that the Texas State Guard is using the TIR as 			an exercise for disaster preparedness!  We don't know if it is a compliment that the TIR is being likened to a disaster... we prefer to call the TIR an act of God!</p>",
		"<p>Yes and no. There may be exchange points where a kind sponsor may provide food, and there are certainly 			many restaurants along the route. We have even heard stories of exceptionally benevolent teams! BUT, if you are counting on the TIR to feed you, then you may be in for 			quite an arduous endeavor!  In all seriousness, it is up to the teams to bring or acquire their own food and hydration.</p>",
		"<p>Yes, there are portable restrooms at almost every exchange!  The only notable exception is at Exchange 30 in 			George Bush Park. The parks people will not allow us to put any at this exchange, noting that there are several remotely nearby (at other places in the park).</p>"

		"<p>While there are hotels in Sealy, Brookshire, and Katy that are plausible, those that have tried this have found that they 			really don't have much time at all to make use of their rooms.  The most popular option is to stay a couple of hours at Brazos High School in Wallis, about 2 			miles east of Exchange 21 on Hwy36.  The folks in Wallis ask for a suggested donation of $5/person for the use of the facilities (including showers!), which they 			use as a fundraiser. Besides these two options, some teams find parking lots and sleep in their vans.<br/><br/><br />			<strong>Do not attempt to sleep in any place in which there is ANY WAY POSSIBLE that a van could reach.</strong></p>",
		"<p>Yes, at most of the night time exchanges, there are large traffic construction floodlights that light up the area well.</p>",
		"<p>Late Saturday night, the teams converge closer together.  So, while there is a chance that some of the 			faster teams could still be alone in the back, the vast majority of the teams will be amongst other teams.  So, it is unlikely that your night time runners will 			be all alone, not able to see any one else.  The first year, this was by far the most asked question, but it is not nearly asked as often now, and we more often 			hear about how the nighttime legs are many runners' favorites!<br/><br/><br />			That being the case, if your team does find itself up ahead of the race, or in a gap in which there are no other teams, your team can employ a technique called 			`shadowing` your runner.  Shadowing your runner does NOT mean driving slowly right behind your runner.  Driving behind your runner is not permissible.  Also, 			in order to do so, either the runner would be running on the wrong side of the road, or the vehicle would be driving on the wrong side.  To shadow your runner, 			the driver of the active van would pull ahead of the runner about 1/4 mile, still able to see the runner's blinkies and flashlight (the runner is also able to 			see the van).  The van will pull completely off the road, and put on the hazard lights.  Depending on the conditions, the driver may want to keep two wheels 			on the pavement (getting stuck is sort of a bummer).  Then the van will watch as the runner goes by.  (As an aside, if teammates get out to cheer on the runner, 			it is VERY important that they, too wear reflective gear and lights, and they must use good judgement... not running across the road in front of other vehicles, 			or anything like that.  Other drivers are aware of the runners, but they often do not expect spectators, too.)  After the team's runner gets about a 1/4 mile ahead, 			the van will pull out, pass the runner, and repeat the process.  It only takes a few repetitions of this before your team reaches the next exchange.</p>",
		"<p>Yes, not only will your team be required to show that you have reflective gear and 			lights to run with at night (flashlights and/or headlamps are required and blinkies are strongly recommended), but you'll simply want them to be very visible 			at night.  You should wear these items when starting a leg after 7PM on Saturday (the sun will be down at 8PM) until the sun comes up Sunday morning.</p>",
		"<p>No. Well, maybe...  Runners may not have earbuds in their ears or headphones covering their ears, but 			there are some phones with a loud enough speaker that can be used.  We've also seen other creative ways to hear tunes, BUT it is very important that this does not impede			your hearing and general awareness. </p><p> Teams often jam to music in the vans, so you could totally rock your tunes while riding.</p>",
		"<p>Quickly... Severely... <br/><br/></p>			<p>Seriously, though, the rules are there for your (and everyone's) safety.  We have a `Safety Patrol` staff that continuously monitors the course, and one 			thing we are particularly stringent about... if they stop and ask you to do something, we need you to do it. Thanks!!  Also, a number is provided before the event for teams to help keep each other safe.</p>"

Don't sleep.<br />			<strong>3)</strong> It takes some time to work into this regimen, so for the first week, only do this one day.  However, add another day each week, so that by 			the 7th week, you are doing this for all 7 days!<br/><br/><br />			Immediately after finishing this, you'll be ready for the TIR.  Congratulations!!!<br/><br/><br />			Or, an alternative plan would be to train as though you would for a good Half-Marathon!</p>",
